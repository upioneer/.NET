Notes
  .NET 3.5 installation requires an internet connection unless you use local media.
  DISM will fail on Windows 10/11 if you canâ€™t reach Windows Update and don't provide a source path.
  For offline or secure environments, include the SXS folder from the ISO in your package or reference a network share.
